# Digit Recognition with LeNet Architecture

This project is a digit recognition system based on the LeNet architecture. It uses deep learning techniques to accurately recognize hand-written digits from images.

## Overview

The LeNet architecture is a classic convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for tasks like digit recognition. In this project, we have implemented a LeNet-based model to recognize hand-written digits, primarily using the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- LeNet architecture for digit recognition.
- Preprocessing and data augmentation techniques.
- Training, validation, and testing phases.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.

## Installation

To run the project, you'll need to install the required dependencies. Here are the steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedchaudhari/Digit-Recognition-Lenet5.git


2. Install the required packages using : pip install -r requirements.txt


##Usage
Prepare your dataset or use the provided MNIST dataset.
Train the model using train.py.
Test the model using test.py.
You can also use the pre-trained model for inference.

## DATASET : MNIST

##Results
Accuracy : 98.04%
